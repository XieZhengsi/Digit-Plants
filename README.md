# Digit-Plants
Digit-Plants is a Mobile App using PhoneGap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery,etc for children get the knowledge on plants.

I have developed a prototype Digital Plants mobile application for the client. My prototype application provide friendly user interface for the student whose age is from 9 to 10 and it can very easy to let the student to utilize all functions of the app. 

The app can provide quick browse function to let the user easily to explore all the plants stored in the local database. It also allow user to browse by category than can easily allow the user find the plant by category. 

When user selects specific plant in the browse screen, it will go to the detail information page to provide image and description for the user. Also, user can directly collect the favor plant in detail page and later they can see what they collected in the collection screen. On the other hands, this app can allow user search the plants by name, species, color and type 

When the student discover a beautiful flower, this app can allow user to record what they find and can immediately record the GEO location and use the camera to take a photo in a record. Whilst user can very easily to manage the record such as delete and recover the record and also can export the record via suitable method.
